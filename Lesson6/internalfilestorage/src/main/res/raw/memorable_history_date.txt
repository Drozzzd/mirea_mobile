April 12, 1961 â€” The first human space flight
On April 12, 1961, Yuri Gagarin became the first person to fly into space. This day is celebrated as Cosmonautics Day.
 Gagarin's flight on the Vostok-1 spacecraft opened a new era in space exploration and made him a national hero and a symbol of Soviet space achievement.
 The flight lasted only 108 minutes, but during this time Gagarin made one orbit around the Earth.
